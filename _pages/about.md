Hi! I am Ranran Shen (申冉冉), a computer science master student in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) of [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). And I feel very lucky to be advised by Prof.[Pan Peng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ppeng/).
Previously, I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Central South University (CSU)](https://en.csu.edu.cn/) in 2022.

My research interests lie broadly in sublinear algorithms and graph algorithms. Specifically, I am currently focusing on sublinear-time clustering algorithms on graphs. So far, my work has involved studying sublinear-time spectral clustering oracles, and I am now beginning to explore clustering challenges in MPC (Massively Parallel Computation) model. If you are interested in TCS, please refer to the [CS Theory Group at USTC](https://tcs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) webpage for more information.

<ins>A Sublinear-time Spectral Clustering Oracle with Improved Preprocessing Time</ins> (**NeurIPS'2023**)

**Ranran Shen**, Pan Peng

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17878) [**Poster**](https://neurips.cc/media/PosterPDFs/NeurIPS%202023/72688.png?t=1701588568.181395)
- We address the problem of designing a sublinear-time spectral clustering oracle for graphs that exhibit strong clusterability. Previous oracles have relied on either a $\textrm{poly}(k)\cdot\log n$ gap between inner and outer conductances or exponential (in $k/\varepsilon$) preprocessing time. Our algorithm relaxes these assumptions, albeit at the cost of a slightly higher misclassification ratio.
