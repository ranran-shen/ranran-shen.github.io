<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am Ranran Shen (申冉冉), a computer science master student in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://en.cs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) of [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Pan Peng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ppeng/).
The most fortunate thing for my early PhD life is that I met up with my brilliant professors!
Previously, I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from Central South University in 2022.

My research interest includes machine learning and natural language processing. Specifically, I work on making human beings and neural network systems better understand each other (i.e., generalization and interpretability). I currently focus on investigating the compositionality of language models from the perspectives of generalization, reasoning pattern, implicit structure and so on, which is about the mechanism that language models decompose complex questions and concepts into primitive ones and re-compose them step-by-step to grasp the complex semantic meaning. Recently the emerging term ["System-1 thinking v.s. System-2 thinking"](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/system-1-and-system-2-thinking) also closely relates to my projects. I would love to discuss on related topics should anyone is interested (always feel free to drop me an email: lizhaoyi777\[AT\]mail.ustc.edu.cn)!

<ins>A Sublinear-time Spectral Clustering Oracle with Improved Preprocessing Time</ins> (**NeurIPS'2023**)

**Ranran Shen**, Pan Peng

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17878) [**Poster**](https://neurips.cc/media/PosterPDFs/NeurIPS%202023/72688.png?t=1701588568.181395)
- We address the problem of designing a sublinear-time spectral clustering oracle for graphs that exhibit strong clusterability. Previous oracles have relied on either a $\textrm{poly}(k)\cdot\log n$ gap between inner and outer conductances or exponential (in $k/\varepsilon$) preprocessing time. Our algorithm relaxes these assumptions, albeit at the cost of a slightly higher misclassification ratio.
